## Description

This project invites users to navigate a multi-screen story using a state-based approach. Players make choices that affect two stats, balancing their relationship and their work presentation. Ultimately, they reach one of four possible endings. The story includes an intro screen, instructions with a back button, multiple game screens, and outcome screens. The layout of the game screens is inspired by Dispatch, as shown in class.

## Setup & Interaction Instructions

User begins by reading the story context:

- Click "How to Play" for Instructions
- Click "Start" to begin the story

User then progresses through three scenes (Kitchen, Train Station, Office), clicking on choices to influence their stats:

- Connection: Starts at 40%.
- Delay: Starts at 0 mins

Stats update after each choice. At the end, a Connection score below 40% triggers a breakup, and a Delay score above 10 mins results in being fired.
